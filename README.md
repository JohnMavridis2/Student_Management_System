# Student_Management_System
A web app made with React and SpringBoot for fun and practice! :)

The professor can connect to the system with the username:prof & password:prof. <br/>
He can delete students and update the data in the Database. <br/>
The students can create an account and then they can log in and watch their grades <br/>
